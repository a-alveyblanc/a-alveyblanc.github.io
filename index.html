		<h3>Addison Alvey-Blanco</h3>
	<p>
		I am an undergraduate student at Northern Illinois University double
		majoring in computer science and computational mathematics. 
	</p>
	<p>
		My research interests lie in the areas of computer security, and
		numerical linear algebra. Currently, I am involved in an independent study
		of automatic differentiation. This study focuses on the mathematical
		foundations of automatic differentiation, and the performance of the
		different modes of automatic differentiation in Julia and C++. The project,
		and all of its up-to-date details, can be found <a
