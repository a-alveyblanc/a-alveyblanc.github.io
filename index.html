    "Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focusing on the study of chaos â€”
    dynamical systems whose apparently random states of disorder and
    irregularities are actually governed by underlying patterns and
    deterministic laws that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.
    Chaos theory is an interdisciplinary theory stating that, within the
    apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying
    patterns, interconnectedness, constant feedback loops, repetition,
    self-similarity, fractals, and self-organization. The butterfly effect,
    an underlying principle of chaos, describes how a small change in one state
    of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a
    later state (meaning that there is sensitive dependence on initial
    conditions). A metaphor for this behavior is that a butterfly flapping
    its wings in Texas can cause a hurricane in China." (Source:

    "Various physical systems, such as crystals and the hydrogen atom, may be
    modelled by symmetry groups. Thus group theory and the closely related
    representation theory have many important applications in physics,
    chemistry, and materials science. Group theory is also central to public
    key cryptography." (Source:
