		<h3>Addison Alvey-Blanco</h3>
	<p>
	    I am a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
        Currently, I am working on dependency analysis for automatic GPU code
        generation with Andreas Kloeckner. Broadly, I am interested in all
        aspects of high-performance GPU code generation for scientific computing
        applications.

        This page will eventually serve as a place to house some interesting
        things I've done, I am doing, or I want to do.
