    <h3>Addison Alvey-Blanco</h3>
    <p>
        I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Illinois at
        Urbana-Champaign where I'm advised by 
        <a href="https://mathema.tician.de/aboutme/">Andreas Kloeckner</a>.
        I am interested in all things related to GPUs; from writing highly
        performant kernels to implementing compiler transformations for 
        automatically generating highly performant kernels, and even getting my
        hands dirty with PTX and SASS.
        <br /><br />
        I like to imagine a world where application engineers, performance
        engineers, and compiler engineers each have their own level of
        abstraction to work at via a 
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19927">scheduling language</a>.
        <br /><br />
        If I had more time, I would spend it learning more about 
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11474">
        randomized numerical linear algebra</a>.
        <br /><br />
        This page is under construction and, one day, I hope to have a write-up
        of each of my projects I mentioned above and what I learned from them.
