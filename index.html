	<p>
		I am an undergraduate student at Northern Illinois University double
		majoring in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		My current research interests lie in the broad areas of computer
		security, machine learning, numerical analysis, and numerical linear
		algebra. Currently, I am involved in an independent study of Automatic
		Differentiation. This project focuses on the mathematical foundations of
		automatic differentiation and the performance of forward- and reverse-mode
		automatic differentiation in Julia and C++. The project, and all of its
		up-to-date details, can be found <a href="https://github.com/a-alveyblanc/auto-diff">
		here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		My specific interests are adversarial
		machine learning, category theory as applied to programming languages, and
		sparsity detection in matrices.
